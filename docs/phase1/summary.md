Project Objectives:

The objective of this project is to create a single source of reliable information about entering and working in Canada’s
FinTech sector. The single information hub will allow interested users in government, academic, or cooperate firms, agencies,
or groups to search information about FinTech, AI, innovation, and investing in Canada. The search results provided to the user
will automated answers that are update to date with previous recorded information stored by Digital Finance Institute (DFI). 

In addition to being a hub of reliable recorded information, users will be allowed to add new information, which has not yet
been recorded. New information suggested by users should be validated via a reputable source before being added and aggregate
in the database. Information provided to the user should be present with a link to the source (if applicable). 

Furthermore, user must be able to securely access information and their history of interactions with our system.  


Key Users:  
The users will be government, NGOs, academia, investors, startups, tech firms and investment firms but also open to academia, government agencies,  
services firms such as legal, consulting, accounting and marketing firms, and importantly, foreign countries that are interested in investing in Canada.
