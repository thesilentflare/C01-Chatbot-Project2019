##What is an existing product that does the same thing as our ChatBot?

###Facebook Messenger
When you say times or common event key phrases, messenger will auto suggest scheduling an event at (place) or at (time) or for (this particular event i.e movie viewing)
 
###Google Allo
When talking with a contact, Google Allo analyzes chat messages and make suggestion and answer questions posed by users powered by google’s search data
 
###Alexa
When you speak to Alexa, it uses speech recognition software that converts speech into commands. Alexa is command based where it has a database of commands stored that is 
mapped to different functions. Users can also develop their own set of custom commands with their open source development suite.
 
###Siri
When spoken to, Siri uses speech recognition and natural language processing. When you speak to siri, speech recognition converts spoken words into textual form, which is 
then sent to Apple servers where they run it through multiple machine learning algorithms using natural language processing to try to understand the intent of the text. 
Once it understands the text it will perform its necessary tasks.

**Who is it better for?**  
Corporate owners/business partners/investors

**When is it better for these people?**
