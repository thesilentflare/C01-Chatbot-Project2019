#UX/UI design

As we are focusing more on the user experience in this initial design many aspects have been simplified to better represent the major important design.

##Landing page
After the user arrives at the main DFI website, they may click on a tab in the navigation bar and are brought to the first page of the Chatbot:
![home](/assets/phase1/wireframes/home.png)

From this page the user may choose to create an account, use the service as guest, or log in with an existing account.
For simplicity sake, the create account page is not included in this revision of the wireframes to better bring across the main functionalities of the chatbot.

##Main Search
Once the user has logged in either with an account or as guest, they will be presented with the main search page:
![home](/assets/phase1/wireframes/mainsearch.png)
